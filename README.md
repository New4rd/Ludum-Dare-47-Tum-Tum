## Depository for my participation to the Ludum Dare 47

That depository is the source code for our participation to the Ludum Dare 47. The programming was made using Unity3D, and the visual aspect was made using Photoshop. All of the visuals and the code are open to external use and/or modification.

Built around the theme "Stuck in the loop", Tum-Tum: An Unexpected Diet is a game where you control Tum-Tum, a fat cat who can't even clean himself. To solve his problems, he will call a shaman, and will go back to the past to fight the origin of his anxiety.

### How to play:

The player is in an home and must catch the mouse. The game restarts everytime the player catches the target, and a ghost of his previous path appears on the screen to disturb him. If the player touches a ghost, he loses. If he manages to catch all of the mice, he wins.

Use arrows to move / Press 'R' button to reset the game / Press spacebar to navigate between cutescenes
